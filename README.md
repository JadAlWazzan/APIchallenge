# APIchallenge

In this Challenge I was tasked to make a Web App to be able to connect to an API,
Authenticate the Username & Password, 
create a cookie if authentication is valid and sign the user name and allow him to check the table,
add transactions, view current month or view all transactions. 

Using Javascript, Jquery, PHP & CSS.
